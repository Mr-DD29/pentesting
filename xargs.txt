hello dudes in this file we gone a see about xargs command

this fill may be updated, when new technic is found "if you know more then this plz collabrate or commant below"

xargs command is used to get the standard input and execute some operation

first we start with basic stage to deep inside to xargs

eg: echo "user1 user2 user3" | xargs 
->this will only print the user1,2,3
output:

eg: ls | xargs
->"ls" will list the files and folder in line by line, this output pass through the "xargs"
 it take it as input and print it in single line.
output:
ADB.py Foot Ball PhoneSploit python python video.mp4 README.license tool.py work

eg: echo "folder1 folder2 folder3" | xargs mkdir
->the above command is equal to the "mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3", simple this command create the folder.
The xargs get the input from the echo and create the folder

eg: ls | xargs rm -r 
->this command will remove all the folders and file in the current location, this equals to the "rm -r *"

eg: find ./ -name "*.txt" | xargs -a "navybird"
-> first the "find" command will print all the ".txt" file in current location and sub dir location, then output pass to xargs using "|"
-> xargs "-a" will read the each file, not the standard output 

eg: seq 3 | xargs echo "number:"
output:(for seq 3)
1 
2 
3 
output:(seq 3 | xargs echo "number:")
number: 1 2 3
-> But this not we expect we need line by line so for that

eg: seq 3 | xargs -n 1 echo "number:"
->the "-n" command will note the number of variables to print in line
output:(seq 3 | xargs -n 1 echo "number:")
number: 1
number: 2
number: 3

eg: echo "1 2 3 4 5" | xargs -d " " -I {} touch file{}
-> "-d" is a delimiter in xargs "-I {}" will a variables identifier and touch command is used to create file
-> first "-d" will split the value using the " "(space) and -I {} as variables identifier
-> secound the touch file{<parameter>} will create the file
output:(ls)
example.txt
output:(echo "1 2 3 4 5" | xargs -d " " -I {} touch file{})
example.txt
file 1
file 2
file 3
file 4
file 5
how to print command that are executed:
eg: echo "one two three" | xargs -t rm
output:rm one two three.
-> the "-t" option prints each command that will be executed to the termianl.this can be helpful when debugging scripts.

how to view the command and prompt for execution:
eg:echo "one two three" | xargs -p touch
-> The "-p" command will print the command to be executed and promt the user to run it.

how to copy file to multiple folders:
eg:echo ./Templates/ ./Documents/ | xargs -n 1 cp -v ./Downloads/navy.jpg
->it will copy file navy.jpg to ./Templates/navy.jpg and ./Downloads/navy.jpg

how to rename all file or subdirectoies in a particular directory to lowercase:
eg:find Documents - depthh |xargs -n 1 rename -v 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2' {} \;
